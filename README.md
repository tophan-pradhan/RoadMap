🚀 RoadMap Application

📌 Overview

RoadMap is an Android application designed to capture and process road-related data efficiently. The app records videos, extracts frames, processes them using APIs, converts them into text, and integrates mapping features using Mapbox. Additionally, it stores gyroscope and IMU data for further analysis.

🌟 Features

🎥 Video Recording: Capture road data through video.

🖼️ Frame Extraction: Convert recorded videos into multiple frames for processing.

⚙️ API Processing: Process extracted frames using APIs to extract meaningful information.

📝 Text Conversion: Convert processed frames into text format.

🗺️ Map Integration: Implemented using Mapbox for location-based visualization.

📊 Gyro & IMU Data Storage: Store gyroscope and IMU data for motion analysis.

🛠️ Technologies Used

📱 Android (Java/Kotlin) for application development

🗺️ Mapbox SDK for mapping features

🖼️ OpenCV or ML APIs for image processing

🗄️ SQLite / Firebase for data storage

🏎️ Sensors (Gyroscope & IMU) for motion data collection
